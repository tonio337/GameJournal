Prior to today, made a bare-bones skeleton UI in Android app. Added types for Game and Journal (with internal Entry).  Started to populate sample data (manually, could not get SampleData Android Tools function to work).

Today, expanded Journal functionality the littlest bit and expanded Unit test (63% coverage as of today). Installed and configured Git local repository. Pushed out to remote repository on Github. (Also made prior personal repoistories on Github private.)

Established API key for IDGB game database. Intend to use IDGB for game data lookup rather than storing it manually.

Finally, will likely use this file's notes to base the commit message, until I'm more comfortable with Git commits.
